<h2 class="text-center text-danger">About the project</h2>
<p>	A Student Management System (SMS), also known as a Student Information System (SIS), is a software application designed to manage all data related to students from the day they join until they graduate. It unites every aspect of the Student Lifecycle in a single place under a single, easy-to-use configurable platform. Here are some key features of an SMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>	Student Details Entry: The system allows new students to register, providing all necessary details such as name, roll number, course details, etc.</li>
    <li>	Attendance Management: The system facilitates the tracking of daily student attendance in schools, colleges, and institutes.</li>
    <li>	Department Management: The system allows for the management of different departments within the institution.</li>
    <li>	Search Functionality: The system provides robust search functionality, including the ability to find student records by roll number, first name, and courses registered.</li>
</ul>
<p>	The SMS integrates students, parents, teachers, and the administration. It helps in tracking student activity, classroom progress, and other development milestones. Without an SMS, schools would become disorganized, staff would lack clarity into scheduling and student activity, and it would become increasingly difficult for school districts to leverage data in the decision-making process.</p>
